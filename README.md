# Thumbnails Convention Metadata

- **UUID**: 49326c01-1180-4743-b15f-f7157038a6ab
- **Name**: Thumbnails

## Description

This convention allows a Zarr node to refer to thumnbails which represent that node in some way.
All properties are under the `thumbnails` key placed at the root `attributes` level following the [Zarr Conventions Specification](https://github.com/zarr-conventions/zarr-conventions-spec).

Thumbnails SHOULD be stored in a well-supported image format (e.g. JPEG, PNG).

Thumbnails SHOULD include at least one small image (under 200KB and longest edge between 128px and 512 px) suitable for fast loading in an image gallery.
Thumbnails MAY include larger files for detail panels or hover previews.
Thumbnails MAY include smaller files for specialized used cases, such as icon-sized previews.

How a thumbnail "represents" a Zarr node is up to the data owner.
As examples, a thumbnail MAY be

- a low-resolution greyscale 2D slice from the middle of a Zarr array
- a descriptive excerpt from one scale level of a multiscale array pyramid
- a logo

Examples:

- [Simple example also shown below](examples/spec_example.json)

## Motivation

- **Viewer consistency**: Users interacting with the same data across multiple viewers may be helped by the same thumbnails
- **Owner control**: Data owners are more likely than viewers to know which parts of an array or group is "representative"

## Convention Registration

The convention must be registered in `zarr_conventions`:

```json
{
  "zarr_conventions": [
    {
      "schema_url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zarr-conventions/thumbnails/refs/tags/v1/schema.json",
      "spec_url": "https://github.com/zarr-conventions/thumbnails/blob/v1/README.md",
      "uuid": "49326c01-1180-4743-b15f-f7157038a6ab",
      "name": "thumbnails",
      "description": "Metadata for thumbnails representing Zarr data"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Applicable To

This convention can be used with these parts of the Zarr hierarchy:

- [x] Group
- [x] Array

## Properties

All properties are placed at the root `attributes` level. To avoid attribute name collisions with other conventions, this convention supports the following pattern [remove the pattern irrelevant for this convention]:

All convention properties are nested under a single `thumbnails` key.

**Convention metadata name**: `thumbnails`

| Field Name | Type                                            | Description                      |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| thumbnails | array of [thumbnails Object](#thumbnail-object) | **REQUIRED**. Thumbnail details. |

**Example**:

```jsonc
{
  "zarr_format": 3,
  // ...
  "attributes": {
    "zarr_conventions": [{ "name": "thumbnails", "spec_url": "..." }],
    "thumbnails": [
      {
        "width": 96,
        "height": 96,
        // optional
        "attributes": {
          // unstructured
          "z_slice": 123,
          "xy_offset": [128, 256],
          "downsampling": "gaussian",
        },
        "media_type": "image/jpeg",
        // relative path downward from this zarr node to the thumbnail storage key
        "path": "thumbails/thumb96.jpeg",
      },
      {
        "width": 48,
        "height": 48,
        "media_type": "image/png",
        // optional
        "description": "Very small thumbnail",
        // URL to external
        "url": "https://image.host/thumb48.png",
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

### Thumbnail Object

When using the nested pattern, all properties are contained in the `thumbnails` object:

| Field Name  | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| width       | number | **REQUIRED**. Image width in pixels as a positive integer.                                                                                             |
| height      | number | **REQUIRED**. Image height in pixels as a positive integer.                                                                                            |
| media_type  | string | **REQUIRED**. [Media type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/MIME_types) (formerly MIME type).                                  |
| description | string | Free-text description of this thumbnail's context; could be used as [alt text](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/alt). |
| attributes  | object | Unstructured arbitrary metadata about the thumbnail; could store information about how it was generated or how it represents the zarr node.            |
| path        | string | Relative path from Zarr storage prefix of this node to the thumbnail object; MUST NOT contain `..` or `.` segments.                                    |
| url         | string | URL to externally-hosted thumbnail; possibly a [data URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Reference/Schemes/data).                    |

Exactly one of `path` and `url` MUST be given.
`path` MUST refer to a descendant of the node's prefix.
